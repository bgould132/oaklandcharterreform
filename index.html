                        <p>Since January 2025, we've communicated with roughly 200 stakeholders about Oakland's government structure (<a href="about.html">see who we are here</a>). Everyone we've met with – many with decades of experience working for, or in partnership with, the Oakland city government – told us that Oakland's flawed city charter is either partly or largely responsible for the City's dysfunction.</p>
                        
                        <p>The recent recall of Mayor Sheng Thao represents a peak moment of dissatisfaction with Oakland's government. No other mayor in Oakland's 173-year history has ever been recalled from office. An astonishing 79% of Oakland residents feel the City is on the wrong track.</p>
                        
                        <p>As SPUR said in <a href="https://www.spur.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/SPUR_Making_Government_Work.pdf">their 2021 report</a>, Oakland's hybrid structure "makes it difficult to establish accountability for the effective functioning of government, since it leaves open the question of which branch of government is in charge". In other words - the buck stops nowhere.</p>

                        <p>
                            Oakland's Federal-style charter creates a weak mayor, frustrated council, conflicted city attorney, and a revolving door of leadership. This system, designed for checks and balances at the national level, leads to inefficiency and lack of accountability at the city level. <a href="files/InBrief_1.pdf" target="_blank">Read the full InBrief (PDF)</a>

                            Most California cities use a unitary council–manager system, which is more efficient and accountable. Case studies from San Jose, Long Beach, and Sacramento show why this model works and how it addresses common critiques. <a href="files/InBrief_2.pdf" target="_blank">Read the full InBrief (PDF)</a>

                            <p>We propose a modern "best-of-both" model that pairs a visible, city-wide elected Mayor with a professional City Administrator.  The Mayor leads and sets policy; the Administrator runs day-to-day services.  Clear roles mean faster action, less finger-pointing and better results for Oaklanders.</p>
                            <ul class="amendment-list">
                                <li><strong>One Government, One Leader:</strong> The Mayor chairs the City Council, helps set the agenda and can veto legislation—so everyone knows who's in charge and whom to hold accountable.</li>
                                <li><strong>Professional Management:</strong> The City Council - led by the Mayor - hires a proven, non-political City Administrator who keeps City Hall running smoothly no matter who is in elected office.</li>
                                <li><strong>Shared Power, Clear Roles:</strong> The Mayor provides big-picture leadership, the Council passes laws and budgets,and the Administrator delivers results—ending today's confusion about "who does what."</li>
                                <li><strong>Better Everyday Service:</strong> With clear authority and professional management, potholes get filled, budgets stay balanced and residents get answers faster.</li>
