                        <p>Every stakeholder we've met with – many with decades of experience working for or in partnership with the Oakland city government – told us that Oakland's flawed city charter is either partly or largely responsible for the City's dysfunction.</p>
                        
                        <p>The recent recall of Mayor Sheng Thao represents a peak moment of dissatisfaction with Oakland's government. No other mayor in Oakland's 173-year history has ever been recalled from office. An astonishing 79% of Oakland residents feel the City is on the wrong track.</p>
                        
                        <p>Oakland's "hybrid structure makes it difficult to establish accountability for the effective functioning of government since it leaves open the question of which branch of government is in charge." In other words - the buck stops nowhere.</p>

Because settling matters about the City's organization in advance of the November 2026 mayoral election will allow candidates to run for a clearly defined role in the new system.</p>

                            <h3>Governance Structure</h3>
                            <p>Oakland's hybrid governance structure has created confusion about who is responsible for what. We propose moving to a clear governance structure where lines of authority and accountability are well-defined:</p>
                            <ul class="amendment-list">
                                <li><strong>Put the Mayor in charge of Council:</strong> The Mayor's disconnection from Council is a source of dysfunction. It drives status competitions between the two bodies, diminishing service for Oaklanders. It leaves the Mayor less effective and unable to deliver on their policy priorities. Making Oakland's Mayor the chair of the Council would give the Mayor a strong voice in Council decisions, and help ensure that the Council is responsive to the Mayor's agenda.</li>
                                <li><strong>Council-Manager System:</strong> Reverting to a professional city manager government where the city council serves as the board of directors with a mayor acting as council chair.</li>
