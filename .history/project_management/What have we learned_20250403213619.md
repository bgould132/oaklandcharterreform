What Have We Learned?

Summary of Charter Reform Focus Group Research
Between January 1 and March 15, 2025, we convened three focus groups and met with a diverse range of Oakland stakeholders in one-on-one interviews. We also led a special information session with leaders of the Oakland NAACP.  In all, we’ve contacted more than 100 people since December regarding the City’s charter, including community members, workers and leaders, business stakeholders, elected officials, lawyers, good government advocates, and more. 

What Have We Learned?
Every single stakeholder we met – many with decades of experience working for and in partnership with the Oakland city government – told us that Oakland’s flawed city charter is largely or at least partly responsible for the City’s dysfunction.  In sum:
–There is broad dissatisfaction with Oakland's current condition and government structure.  
–There is consensus that Oakland's current charter is poorly designed, as well as near-unanimous agreement that Oakland's charter can be improved and should be revised.
–There is broad agreement that Oakland should either strengthen the mayor’s office or adopt a Council-Manager government with a directly elected mayor who serves as presiding officer of the city council.  While people are on both sides of this issue, everyone agrees that either option would be preferable to the current charter.

What Are the Top Charter Issues?
More specifically, our participants have called out the following charter issues as important to address:  
–Strong-Mayor vs. Council-Manager form of government, and permutations and variations thereof, including powers of the Mayor. 
–City Attorney appointment.  Should the City Attorney be independently elected or, instead, appointed by and report to the City Council?
–Ranked-choice voting.  Several people said they are dissatisfied with the process and outcomes delivered by ranked-choice voting.
–Commission effectiveness.  We heard repeated requests to reform Oakland’s commissions to improve transparency, responsiveness, effectiveness, efficiency, and equity outcomes.  
–Financial guardrails.  We heard scattered calls for an independent controller who provides real-time monitoring and reporting on expenditures, revenues, and contract adherence.
