Why Charter Reform?  Why Now?

“Oakland’s government is designed to fail.” 
“In Oakland, the buck stops nowhere.” 

These are real statements we’ve heard from Oaklanders since initiating the Oakland Charter Reform Project in December.  We’ve convened three focus groups and met with dozens of leading Oakland stakeholders in one-on-one interviews. We’ve met with leaders of the Oakland NAACP.  We’ve talked to more than 100 people about the City’s charter, including community members, workers and leaders; business stakeholders; city commissioners; elected officials; lawyers; good government advocates; and more. 

Every single stakeholder we’ve met with – many with decades of experience working for or in partnership with the Oakland city government – told us that Oakland’s flawed city charter is either partly or largely responsible for the City’s dysfunction. 

Wrong Track

This is not a new finding. SPUR, the Bay Area’s leading non-profit government research and advocacy organization, studied Oakland extensively in 2020 and 2021. SPUR researchers likewise interviewed more than fifty knowledgeable stakeholders – including former mayors, councilmembers, and city administrators – and concluded that Oakland’s “hybrid structure makes it difficult to establish accountability for the effective functioning of government since it leaves open the question of which branch of government is in charge.”  In other words - the buck does indeed stop nowhere.

The result? Nearly 80% of Oaklanders think the city is on the wrong track. 
During our ten-week listening tour, we found that:

There is broad dissatisfaction with Oakland's current condition and government structure.  


There is consensus that Oakland's current charter is poorly designed and near-unanimous agreement that Oakland's charter can be improved and should be revised.


There is broad agreement that Oakland should either strengthen the mayor’s office or adopt a Council-Manager government with a directly elected mayor who serves as presiding officer of the city council.  


While people are on both sides of this issue, everyone agrees that either option would be preferable to the current charter.

Now is the time to reform Oakland’s charter.

Why Now?
The recent recall of Mayor Sheng Thao represents a peak moment of dissatisfaction with Oakland’s government. No other mayor in Oakland's 173-year history has ever been recalled from office.  An astonishing 79% of Oakland residents feel the City is on the wrong track.  We cannot act as if nothing has happened.  To respond to this moment, we must address the root causes of the City’s dysfunction.  Charter reform is the right step for right now. 

We are therefore exploring options for placing a charter reform measure before voters in June 2026.  Why June?  Because settling matters about the City’s organization in advance of the November 2026 mayoral election will allow candidates to run for a clearly defined role (e.g., Strong-Mayor or Council-Manager) in the new system.  Candidates and voters will benefit.  Oakland will benefit.
